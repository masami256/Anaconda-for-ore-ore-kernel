git hooks for anaconda development

commit-msg
    For rhel*-branch branches, ensures that commits reference an
    approved RHEL bug for the appropriate release in the correct
    format.

    To use, copy this script to your .git/hooks directory and make
    sure you have the python-bugzilla package installed.  You might
    also want to create a ~/.rhbzauth file containing two shell
    variables:  RHBZ_USER and RHBZ_PASSWORD to allow automatic login
    when commiting patches.
